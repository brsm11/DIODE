DIODE (DIsc dOg Data Exploration) Project Planning


-Predict time to league promotion (what the best predictors are and with what accuracy this can be predicted would be interesting)
-Predict score of a given dog/handler
-Predict winning club for a season
-Determine best dog breed of all time/handler of all time/ club of all time
-Look for seasonal trends in team/club scores
-predict growth of sport(will have to determine a metric like overall participation) in an area
  --this could have some cool time lapsed visualizations, people love movies
-Extract more concreate stats on players, something like points per throw, total yards (this could be coarsley estimated based on score)
-Is toss and fetch data predictive of that years world champion at skyhoundz, usddn, awi, etc
-what is the participation of world champions in various organizations
  --Do they play in league/updog or is it beneath them
-trends between dog ownership and disc dog growth
-Project could be expanded to include other dog sports, Dock diving, agility, etc.
-Web scrape/ ask for data from other organizations, beginning with "core" disciplines like freestyle, toss and fetch, distance
-Include on field visualizations of scores
  --imagine a heat map of scores overlayed onto an image of the toss and fetch field, this could help the uninitiated understand the games and data better
-Heat map of participation overlayed onto global map to show how the sport is growing world wide
  --imagining something like the growing circles on the pandemic maps, this is a plot everyone now knows how to read
-Investigate how weather affects the data, would need another source for weather data
